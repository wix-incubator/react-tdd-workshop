# React Tdd Workshop

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix/react-tdd-workshop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wix/react-tdd-workshop)

Welcome to my React TDD workshop!

# Getting started

### Working locally

All you need is a mac + node > 6.X.X:

1. `git clone git@github.com:wix/react-tdd-workshop.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm test`
4. Start working :sunglasses:

### Working on a web environment

We have a full online environment which you can use for everything you need!

1. Go to [Cloud 9](https://c9.io) and create an account / login using your Github account
2. Ask me for permissions and link to a workspace
3. npm test
4. Start working :sunglasses:

An alternative Cloud9 setup (If you are not part of this workshop and want to play with it):

1. Create a new workspace in Cloud9
2. Mark it as "node" environment
3. In "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL (optional)" add my github url: `git@github.com:wix/react-tdd-workshop.git`
4. Create workspace
5. npm install
6. npm test

* This alternative setup will require that you will login using your Github account

# What is this workshop about?

We will be building the [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game, using React + Mocha + Puppeteer, all TDD, (almost) without openning the browser!

The end result will be something like this:
